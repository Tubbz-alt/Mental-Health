# NHSX and Mental Health Update 9

This is an informal update to [NHSX‚Äôs commitment](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhsx-digital-experts-will-be-part-of-cancer-and-mental-health-teams) to:
> Digital and data specialists from NHSX will team up with NHS England‚Äôs mental health national policy teams to help clinicians and policymakers improve patient experience through technology.

This is a selection of things that happened (other things also happened) from team members working on [a discovery into children, young people and mental health](https://nhsx.github.io/Mental-Health/0/)...

## User research with Dorset CAMHS

Two of the team took a trip to Poole and Bournemouth to conduct [user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research). We visited two different sites dedicated to children and young people's mental health services (CYPMHS) and spoke with clinical and managerial staff about their experiences and how the service works.

This was [the discovery‚Äôs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) first user research sessions with front line staff. 

It was an extremely useful trip for furthering our knowledge, we really appreciated that people took the time out from their busy jobs to talk to us.

## Waiting time pilots
There are wider efforts with NHS England to address waiting times. [12 pilots have begun around the country](https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/cyp/trailblazers/mh-support-teams/) and 2 fantastic colleagues walked us through the progress so far.

It is interesting to see how our team fits in a broader ambition to improve things and we managed to get some invites which should put us in the same room as those working on the pilots. We also got some 

## User research with Wirral CAMHS

Not only did the team manage to get over to Dorset but we went over to the Wirral to hear more from staff who are delivering care. 
The service is setup differently and once again a fascinating experience to be immersed in the real setting, hearing from real people about how care is delivered and some of the pain points they face.

We got the chance to hear from people receiving referrals, triaging people to get the care they need, clinician who sees children and young people and also the health professionals responsible for a phone line that gives advice and support for parents, children and young people with mental health concerns.

We‚Äôve got more places to visit and people to see before we bring the research together but the passion and dedication of trying to deliver care is always very striking. 

## Show and tells
One of the team spoke at the wider NHS England mental health team meeting to give a swooping overview of work so far. Very kind crowd and interesting question asked after update. We continue to try our best to be vocal and transparent with what we are doing.

## Retrospective and planning
As sprint 2 ended we officially passed the halfway point for this discovery. We got together for our regular retrospective. 2 new NHSX colleagues sat in and got to listen to insights about our work alongside some themed music choices. We are a tight-knit unit and always keep pushing to improve - actions were created and progress was made to make things incrementally better.

Planning was later in the day. Priorities mostly centered around further research in sprint 3. We‚Äôve got quite a lot lined up with children, young people, parents and more visits to CYPMHS. Lots of research and synthesizing research will be done among other tasks.

## User research with children
We‚Äôve been progressing with how best to elicit meaningful responses from children in our user research. We‚Äôve made many iterations to our plans based on input from others outside the team. We are enjoying the methodological challenge of researching with young children.

## Facebook follow-up discussion
To learn about other research and efforts in the CYP mental health/wellbeing space we had a follow up chat with [individual we met a couple of weeks ago](https://nhsx.github.io/Mental-Health/7/).

Illuminating chat. For example, we heard more about communities/peer-support on social media such as groups like [Parenting Mental Health](https://parentingmentalhealth.com/). Their site also has [many stories of individuals experience](https://parentingmentalhealth.com/community-stories/) of being a parent/guardian of someone experiencing mental health issues.

## Idea to scrape reviews from web
We have invested a small amount of time into collecting reviews of CYPMHS clinics on NHS.UK to supplement our user research, to see if we can identify any themes across different sites. 
While only a limited number of reviews are available, and we are aware of bias, we are hoping we might get something interesting out of the exercise. Even if we don‚Äôt get the volume of data we were hoping for this work can provide us with another research tool for future projects.
